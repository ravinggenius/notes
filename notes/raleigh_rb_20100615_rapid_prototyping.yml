Rapid Prototyping and Customer Development: The Hacker's Guide to Software Design
"Good design is exactly what my clients would do if they had my knowledge and skill set."
Assumptions:
  My clients know their business better than anyone else
  The best way I can can assist them...
Customer Development: An iterative process of finding customers and leveraging their feedback...
How it's done:
  An idea
  An assertion
  An experiment
  Customer feedback
  Repeat
"Agile" for business
Rapid prototyping: get a feel for how the product...
Think big: don't underestimate the value of research and brainstorming
Build small: "Take the features you think you need and cut it in half."
Identify the heart of the app
Build and Rebuild: Don't be afraid to throw things away. Prototyping is about learning.
Good design is about good conversations
Design tools:
  whiteboards
    great for brainstorming with customers
    great for illustrating flow
    lightweight
    hard to take with you
  wireframes
    moderately lightweight
    capture more detail
    easy to showoff to customers and stakeholders
    anyone can build them
  paper prototyping
    paper/pen
    balsamiq mockups
    omnigraffle
  hifi mockups
    one step from HTML
    help establish look and feel (also tone)
    typically require professional design help
    most potential for error
    fireworks
  html prototypes
    allow you to test flow
    can be improved over time
    great for client and customer conversations
    can be leveraged for actual application (between 1/4 to 1/3 of the final effort)
    serve framework (on github)
  functional prototypes
    great for refining algorithms, user interactions, gestures, anything that is complex
    also great for client and customer conversations
    don't need to be written in the target language
  other tools
    showoff (in-app prototypes)
    web app theme (rails template)
    compass (css meta-framework)
    little snapper (research for a client)
    skitch (screenshots)
