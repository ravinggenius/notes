Why:
  performance
  wrap a C api
  access to Ruby profiler / Ruby internals
  wrap existing C library to test in Ruby
Examples:
  ...
Pattern:
  ruby.rb
    include the module defined in C, call it like it is Ruby
  c_file.c
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
Data Types:
  Qnil, Qtrue, Qfalse
  RBignum, RFloat, ...
  VALUE == Object

Alternatives:
  stop, isolate (require 'benchmark') & think
  don't do it: take the trouble code out somehow
  keyboard -> whiteboard
